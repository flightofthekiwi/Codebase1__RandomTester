# Codebase1__RandomTester

# This is the code base for a random tester for a data structure
# called My_DataStructure
#
#
# The Random Tester has a number of test cases that test the functionality of the Data Structure
#
# The Data Structure is similar to a Queue but has a fault injected version of it
# 
# The Tester does not know if the Queue is the fault injected version of the queue or the standard version.
